              <h2>How To Make A Basic Web Page</h2>
       
              <p class="alpha-text">
               Today it looks like everyone has a <strong>web page,</strong> and you always see advertisements on the web for free web page hosting.   While it may seem a bit overwhelming to someone who has never done it before, it is easy enough.  Making a basic web page is easy.  All you need to know is a <u>few basic HTML commands,</u> and a <em>computer</em> with the program Notepad (if you have a computer, you have notepad).  First I will explain a little bit about HTML, like what it does, <u><strong>what it means,</strong> </u>and how it works.  Then I will give the most basic tags you will need to know so that you will be able to make a basic web page on your own.  Finally I will give some pointers on how to get a page on the internet.
